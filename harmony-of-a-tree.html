              In the captivating PC game, "Harmony of a Tree," players have the
              task of enlisting the aid of enchanting wood spirits to harmonize
              the three crucial essences of the tree: magic, nutrients, and
              vitality. This is done in a heart-pumping effort to keep the
              magnificent tree alive and thriving. The essence levels need to be
              kept neither too full nor too empty to prevent the tree from dying
              or running away. These essence levels will also be affected by
              weather and time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Players can select a new wood spirit every few seconds and place
              them on the root of the tree to obtain the essence needed. Each
              wood spirit will affect the essence in different ways by either
              increasing or decreasing it. Additionally, they will possess
              unique skills or features that may be known or unknown to players,
              affecting themselves, other wood spirits, weather, time, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wood spirits are known for their distinct traits and abilities,
              which vary from one spirit to another. Some wood spirits strictly
              work only at night, whereas others reset their neighbor spirit's
              working time. There are also those that leave a curse for the next
              spirit, affecting the entire location, and some that can even copy
              abilities from neighboring spirits.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game that showcases these interesting creatures was created
              during the Global Game Jam 2023 under the theme "Root." With the
              collaborative efforts of two game artists and me as the developer,
              we have successfully designed and coded four weather types along
              with over 20 unique skills and features for the wood spirits in
              the game.

              P.s. Although I had high hopes for what I could accomplish in just
              48 short hours, reality set in quickly and I realized I had bitten
              off more than I could chew. My initial plan included implementing
              a range of exciting features such as randomized events, functional
              items and fascinating ruins. While I had to scale back my
              expectations, overall, the experience was nothing short of amazing
              - I relished every moment of it.
